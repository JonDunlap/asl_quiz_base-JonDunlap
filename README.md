# Branding

This branch holds the branding for your application and will be used to create a brand guide

The goal of this branch is to decide on your marketing and design some of the major pages your site will use. Doing this work up front makes your future assignments easier as you will not have to design and create.

Get creative about your topic and make sure you do research to back up your target market.

## Setting up gh-pages

1. Go to "Settings" tab in your github repository
2. Scroll to the "GitHub Pages" section
3. Select "gh-pages branch" from source dropdown

## Creating your Brand Guide

1. Developing:
   1. Clone your repo down
   2. Switch to gh-pages branch
   3. `npm install`
   4. `npm start` (will spin up a server and you can see the changes happening in your settings file)
1. Update the .css and .html files in the styles, pages and brand folders to match the style you want to create for your brand (see below for descriptions of each of the pages)
1. **DO NOT** change the index.html in the root folder, or the brand-guide.css files
1. Get creative with your ideas and content. You do not have to keep all the content on the page but you do need to keep the elements. Feel free to change the design a lot and change all the text.
